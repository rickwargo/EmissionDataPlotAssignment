# Description
# Given a data frame with all of the PM2.5 emissions data for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008. 
# For each year, the table contains number of tons of PM2.5 emitted from a specific type of source for the entire year.
#
# Explore the data and answer the following question:
#   How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999â€“2008 in Baltimore City?
#
# Data Selection
#   As per the US definition of a motor vehicle, it appears the best 
#
# Modification History

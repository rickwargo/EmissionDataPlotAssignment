# Description
# Given a data frame with all of the PM2.5 emissions data for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008. 
# For each year, the table contains number of tons of PM2.5 emitted from a specific type of source for the entire year.
#
# Explore the data and answer the following question:
#   How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999â€“2008 in Baltimore City?
#
# Data Selection
#   As per the US definition of a motor vehicle, it appears the best selection for a motor vehicle is type == 'ON-ROAD'
#   This selection surfaces the following EI.Sector factors, the only ones that are Mobile - On-Road
#     -> Mobile - On-Road Gasoline Light Duty Vehicles
#     -> Mobile - On-Road Gasoline Heavy Duty Vehicles
#     -> Mobile - On-Road Diesel Light Duty Vehicles
#     -> Mobile - On-Road Diesel Heavy Duty Vehicles

# -> Mobile - On-Road Diesel Light Duty Vehicles
# -> Mobile - On-Road Diesel Heavy Duty Vehicles
